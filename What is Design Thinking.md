## Definition
*Design thinking is an iterative process in which you seek to understand your users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions which you can prototype and test.*

**Essence elements of DT**
- not instantly apparent with your initial level of understanding
- creative and collaborative way.
- more than just a process; it opens up an entirely new way to think,
-  understand your user
-  observe and creathe empathy
-  critical thinking
-  good for ill-defined or unknown problems
-  expirementation and test thinking (sketches, prototypes, trials)

Design thinking involves ambiguous, and inherently subjective, concepts such as emotions, needs, motivations and drivers of behavior. This contrasts to solely scientific approaches—quantitative research, for example—where there’s more of a distance between the processes of understanding and the testing of users’ needs and emotions.

## Why DT
** Design Thinking is for Everybody **
-**Attempt to develop new ways of thinking**
-**Have the intention to improve products, services and processes.**
-**Ask significant questions and challenge assumptions**

_Designers resist the temptation to jump immediately to a solution to the stated problem. Instead, they first spend time determining what the basic, fundamental (root) issue is that needs to be addressed_

## What is the problem we need to solve? 
Not the symptoms but the real cause. Fundamental issues tends to be more difficult and require critical thinking.

Problem Defining

## Community driver design / Humanity Centric Design
- The solution has come from people
- Even if you find a correct answer that people don't understand or connect to the solution it won't work
- Probably the people that have the problem already started find out ways to solve it


## Science or Art?
**Both!**

First science with "facts" derived from:
-   Research users’ needs.
-   Pool experience from previous projects.
-   Consider present and future conditions specific to the product.
-   Test the parameters of the problem.
-   Test the practical application of alternative problem solutions.

After finding solutions based on facts you start trying to nulify them

## 5 Phases of Design Thinking?


The phases can be done in parallel, dont need to be cronological (can even reitarate)

 In particular, experts and specialists rely on their solid thought patterns, and it can be very challenging and difficult for experts to start questioning their knowledge.
